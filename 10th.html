			<center><p class="quote">These projects were done sophomore year in Graphic Design 2 and Web Design one. At the begining of the year we started working more into photoshop and learning new skills such as blowing up our heads. Then we were assigned a company who needed a new logo. This is the first project you see on this page. This company was a pizza compay who needed a new logo. We were givin two week sofr this project, whhich gave me a lot of time to really think about what the company wanted. In the image my final two designs are shown. This was the first time we had delt with a client and had gotten feedback and constructive critisism for an outside person. <br><br>Some of the other projects I completed were dont outside of school such at the self portrait of my brother and the dance mural. Thses were really fun to complete because it showed that I could take home the skills I had learned throughout the year and aply them to the things I do at home. I hope you see the progress I have made from freshman year and continue to see that progress going into my junior year. </p></center>
