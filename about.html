			<center><p class="quote">I am a student, cheerleader, and student council member at SWCTA.  I am in the design academy in the Web Design program and enjoy it  very much. I am apart of student council and have become the Student Body Treasurer. I enjoy helping others out with anything such as projects, homework, and or anything else they might need.   Outside of school I participate in karate, Irish dance, NHS, and church confirmation classes.  I usually have no free time due to extra curricular activities, but manage to get straight A's.  I am a diligent worker and really good at being creative and fun with projects. I chose Southwest because I really wanted to try something new. I wanted to try to do something that I could learn and do for a living later in life. I chose web design because I thought I could be really fun, it interested me, and I could even make a living off of it in the future. I really love Southwest. The campus is beautiful and all my teachers are so great and so nice. My mom also works at Southwest. She teaches fashion design for juniors and seniors. It is fun coming to school with her, and it pushes me to get good grades, behave well, and do my best.</p></center>
